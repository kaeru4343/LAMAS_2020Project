# Rules and Components

This is a game for two players.<br />
Each player has a grid of 10x10 that only they can see, pegs to mark an opponent's hits and misses and a number of ships of varying lengths and 1 width.<br />
Various versions of the game have a different numbers of ships, but the default version has:
*   1 Carrier, which has length 5, 
*   1 Battleship, which has length 4, 
*   1 Cruiser, which has length 3, 
*   1 Submarine, which has length 3 and 
*   1 Destroyer, which has length 2. 

For our abridged version, we will be using a 6x6 grid with the following ships:
*   1 Battleship, 
*   1 Cruiser and 
*   1 Destroyer.

The game is played as follows:

1. Each party places down their ships without the knowledge of the opponent. They can place their ships wherever they want on their grid as long as the ships are either vertical or horizontal and they do not intersect other ships or go over the board.<br />  
2. The first round starts. During a round, the players each take a turn to attack a slot on the opponent's board. During an attack, they specify the coordinates they want to check, for example A-5(first row, fifth column), and after this announcement, the opposing player has to announce if the attempt was a hit or a miss and mark it on their grid accordingly.<br />
3. The other player does the same. The round ends and the next round begins. If all of the slots that a ship spans are hit, then the ship is considered to have "sunk" and the player to whom that ship belonged must announce that that particular kind of ship has been sunk.<br />
4. The rounds keep repeating until the ships of either one of the players, or of both (as the round ends after both players have taken a shot, this is possible), have been sunk.<br />

This concludes the rules of the game.
